Transition metal chemistry is important because ...
Inorganic (much more difficult, why?) vs Organic chemistry
Rigorously map them / find distances
Enumerate them
Convert them into RACs
Correlated wavefunction description like DLPNO vs DFT, both structure specific
Multi-fidelity optimization with co-kriging

Due to their wide range of tunable electronic properties, transition metal complexes are of great interest to the field of functional inorganic materials. However, exhaustive enumeration of all possible complexes leads to a vast and impenetrable chemical space. In order to be more tractable, we restrict ourselves to octahedral high symmetry complexes. From previous work we know that proximal features (i.e. from the first and second coordination shell) describe a complex reasonably well, thus we imose a further restriction of two heavy atoms (CONSP) per ligand. Now we can assess complex properties of this chemical subspace using data-driven models. The subspace is represented using the graph theoretical revised autocorrelation functions (RACs) that encode relationships of atomic properties. Since the computational cost to perform high-throughput density functional theory calculations is still very high, we enhance the results with more exact correlated wavefunction calculations like domain-based local pair-natural orbital coupled cluster DLPNO CCSD(T) approximations. To accommodate the results of these composition dependent models, we use machine learning techniques. This approach lets us assess the difference between correlated wavefunction results and DFT results as well deliver an estimation where the DFT result is likely to agree with the correlated wavefunction result.
